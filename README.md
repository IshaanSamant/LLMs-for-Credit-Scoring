# LLMs-for-Credit-Scoring
A project where LLMs are fine tuned on financial based data to perform unbiased analysis of credit risk analysis. Humans and Government Organizations contain some inherent biases towards certain social groups or
people either due to public perception or past track record. The goal of this project is to create an unbaised system to achieve these tasks.
